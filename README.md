# COG-Machine-Learning
Repository of workshop materials for Temple University Coding Outreach Group (COG) summer 2023 workshop series. My workshop focuses on a basic introduction to machine learning in R and Python.


## Machine Learning in R
07/03/2023

**Content creator**: Helen Schmidt

## Description

## Prerequisites
This workshop requires that users:
1. have the R programming language downloaded and installed, which can be accessed here - https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/
2. have the RStudio user interface downloaded, which can be accessed here - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
3. have a basic familiarity with the R programming language.

## What we won't cover
This workshop will focus on manipulating and working with data using a Tidy framework (https://www.tidyverse.org/), although similar results can be achieved using Base R. 

## Set Up (before the workshop)
1. Download the R-markdown script from Github.
2. Install packages required for the workshop in RStudio (using `install.packages()`)
